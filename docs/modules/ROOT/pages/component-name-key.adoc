= Name Key

A component name is defined by assigning a value to the `name` key.

== What's a component name?

A [.term]*component name*, also called [.term]*name*, is the value assigned to the `name` key in a component version descriptor file ([.path]_antora.yml_).
A component name typically represents the name of a project, library, service, etc., such as `fauna`, `rudder`, `nrepl`, etc.
The value of a `name` key, in combination with the value of a `version` key, defines a xref:component-version.adoc[component version].

[#usage]
=== How Antora uses name

The component name is fundamental to many of Antora's operations.
Antora uses the name:

* as the xref:how-antora-builds-urls.adoc#component[component segment] in page and asset URLs, unless the name of the component is _ROOT_.

Additionally, if the component title key isn't set, Antora uses the name:

* to xref:how-component-versions-are-sorted.adoc[sort component versions]
* for display purposes in the reference UI, which includes the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-menu[component version page menu], xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector menu], and
the first breadcrumb position on a component version's pages

Note that component name is case sensitive.
This means that you have two components with the same name that only different in case, Antora will treat them as different components.

Content writers use the name as the xref:page:resource-id-coordinates.adoc#id-component[component coordinate in resource IDs] when referencing a resource in another documentation component.

[#key]
== name key

The `name` key is required.
It's set and assigned a value in a component version descriptor file ([.path]_antora.yml_).

.antora.yml with defined component name
[,yaml]
----
name: colorado # <.>
----
<.> At the beginning of a new line, type `name`, directly followed by a colon and a space (`:{sp}`).
Then type the value you want assigned to `name`.

[#requirements]
=== name requirements

The value assigned to the `name` key can contain letters, numbers, underscores (`+_+`), hyphens (`-`), and periods (`.`).
To ensure portability between host platforms, letters used in the `name` value should be lowercase.

IMPORTANT: We *strongly* encouraged you to select a name that only consists of _lowercase_ characters.
Component names, except for the special _ROOT_ value, are used in your site's URLs, therefore, using consistent casing makes the component name, and thus your site, more portable.
That's because some file systems, and thus the web server running on it, can't distinguish between uppercase and lowercase characters.

The value *cannot* contain spaces, forward slashes (`/`), or HTML special characters (`&`, `<`, or `>`).
The value *cannot* be empty.

See xref:component-title.adoc[] to learn how to display a name that contains spaces, uppercase letters, and other characters in your site's UI.

////
Antora uses the `name` key when interpreting resource IDs and generating the URLs for the component version's pages.
Unless the xref:component-title.adoc[title key is set], it uses `name` for sorting components in the component version selector and where ever the component's name is displayed in the reference UI, which includes the xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-menu[component version page menu], xref:navigation:index.adoc#component-dropdown[component version selector], and
the first breadcrumb position on a component version's pages.
